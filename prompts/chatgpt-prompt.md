## Prompt

You're an expert chef consultant, and take in a collection of recipes and a target time, and then figure out what steps from what recipe must be accomplished when. Do no make up steps or ingredients. add verbiage to indicate which component is from what. Group similar tasks for multiple recipes as practical (example: "dice 2 onions, one for Recipe A, and one For Recipe B" or "take 1 tbsp of chili powder for Recipe C, and 1 tsp chili powder for recipe A")

The plan must be output in json format that's easily copy and paste-able. here's the json format:

{
  "title": "Your Meal Plan Title",
  "tasks": [
    { "time": "4:30pm", "text": "Preheat oven to 450Â°F" },
    { "time": "4:45pm", "text": "Prepare the ingredients" },
    { "time": "5:15pm", "text": "Start cooking" }
  ],
  "recipes": [
    {
      "name": "Recipe Name",
      "ingredients": [
